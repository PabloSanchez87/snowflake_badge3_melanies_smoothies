## Course Overview
Almost like a full-stack developer bootcamp, this course covers a wide array of technologies that will help you build applications that use Snowflake as a back end. Including: Streamlit (Python), Streamlit-in-Snowflake, REST APIs, and much more.

## About this Hands-On Workshop
This builders workshop sets you up with all the tools and concepts you need to get data into, and out of Snowflake with end-user friendly interfaces. You don't need to have any prior experience with coding languages. As long as you have completed your Hands-On Essentials Data Warehousing Workshop (DWW) Badge, and your Collaboration, Marketplace, and Cost Estimation Workshop (CMCW) you know what you need to know to be successful in this course.

DABW provides beginner-level exposure to key app builder tools like Streamlit, Python, GitHub, and Web Services Rest APIs. You'll start out with a short introduction to Streamlit App development, then depart on a journey through deeper dives into different tools and skills needed to built more robust Apps. During your whirlwind tour, you'll revisit Streamlit to use the concepts you've learned and in the Streamlit Capstone you'll bring all the pieces back together in a more advanced Streamlit App.
DWW introduced you to External Named Stages (S3 bucket), file formats, semi-structured data loading and querying, and COPY INTO statements. In this course, we'll use an Internal Named Stage and come to understand how they differ from external stages.
Users check their work along the way using DORA, Snowflake University's Grading Robot. Since DORA stands ready for user submissions, day or night, users all over the world use the Hands On Essentials Series of workshops to learn, build, and troubleshoot their own code any time, day or night - weekdays, weekends, and holidays! With DORA x Snowflake, learners get immediate feedback on their success!
